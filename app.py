A node represents a student and an edge between two students shows that the left student chose the right student as a friend. Higher edge weights indicate more interactions and a edge weight shows that there is no common activity at all.")

    st.write("The moment of selection for the exchange is coming and, in those moments, to be well regarded by the faculty is essential. In this way, Amanda is 100% determined to, if necessary, manipulate all people in college. So she created a system that indicates the weakest link between two people.")
